# SegFormer | SegFormer-Pytorch

This project implements semantic segmentation of urban street scenes using SegFormer, SegFormer with Few-Shot Learning, and Segmenter. The models are trained on the CityScapes dataset, a large-scale benchmark dataset for autonomous driving and urban scene understanding. The goal is to classify each pixel into predefined categories such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians, and buildings.
